DiskWriter makes burning CD and DVD images from the FreeNAS WebUI a snap.  It helps select the appropriate program and drive to use and gives one-click access to installing additional software you may need.

Future versions may include CD/DVD mastering, but currently only prebuilt images are being supported.
